# Example Bootstrap Site


What do you perceive to be the benefits of Bootstrap? Disadvantages?

I think the coolest advantage of Bootstrap is that you can be up and running so quickly without having to reinvent the wheel/foundation of a website. And that it instantly responsive. 

I could see an disadvantage in being that the CSS is less easily customizable.
